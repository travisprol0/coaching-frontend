        JavaScript is a scripting language that is one of the three core
        languages used to develop websites. Whereas HTML and CSS give a website
        structure and style, JavaScript lets you add functionality and behaviors
        to your website, allowing your websiteâ€™s visitors to interact with
        content in many imaginative ways.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        JavaScript is primarily a client-side language, meaning it runs on your
        computer within your browser. However, more recently the introduction of
        Node.js has allowed JavaScript to also execute code on servers.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        Since its release, JavaScript has surpassed Java, Flash, and other
        languages because it is relatively easy to learn, has a free and open
        community, and, most importantly, is incredibly useful, allowing
        developers to quickly create apps with audiences in the millions.
